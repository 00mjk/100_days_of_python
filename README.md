# 100 Days of Python Challenge <br>
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python challenge! This is a personal project where I commit to coding in Python every day for 100 days straight, with the aim of improving my skills and becoming a better programmer.
<br>

# Project Structure <br>
/Day-X - Each day has its own directory, containing a Python script with my code for that day.
README.md - This file, where you are right now, is the main documentation for the project. It includes an overview of the project structure, a list of the topics covered each day, and any additional notes or thoughts.
<br>

# Topics Covered <br>
Throughout this challenge, I will cover a range of Python topics, including:
  <ul>
        <li>Basic syntax and data types</li>
        <li>Control flow statements (if/else, for/while loops)</li>
        <li>Functions and modules</li>
        <li>Functions and modules</li>
        <li>Object-oriented programming</li>
        <li>Basic Web development</li>
        <li>Data analysis with Pandas and NumPy</li>
        <li>Machine learning with Scikit-learn</li>
    </ul>

# Getting Started <br>
If you'd like to participate in the challenge, feel free to fork this repository and start your own 100 Days of Python project. You can customize the project structure and topics covered to suit your own interests and goals.

Alternatively, you can simply follow along with my progress by browsing the code in each day's directory or reading the daily updates on my personal blog.
